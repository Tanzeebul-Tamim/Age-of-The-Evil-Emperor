Alaric takes you aside, leading you to a secluded part of the cavern where the training is most intense. The air is filled with the clash of weapons and the grunts of determined warriors. This is where the hardest training occurs, designed to push even the best to their limits. Sweat pours down your face as you practice advanced combat techniques and defensive maneuvers, each session more grueling than the last.
