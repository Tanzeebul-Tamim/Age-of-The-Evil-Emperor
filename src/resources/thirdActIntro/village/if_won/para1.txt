Alaric<break>Your efforts to rally the villages have proven to be a success, <name>. The newfound allies and resources you've brought to our cause will bolster our strength against the Emperor. Now, we must capitalize on this momentum. The tunnels under the Emperor's fortress offer us a strategic advantage. We must prepare for a covert mission to gather intelligence and strike at the heart of the Emperor's forces. With the support of the villagers and the knowledge from the tunnels, we are closer than ever to achieving victory.
